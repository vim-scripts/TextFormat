This plugin provides commands and key mappings to quickly align and format text. Text can be easily reformatted and aligned to either left or right margin or justified to both margins or centered. The text formatting commands provided by this plugin are a bit more automatic and more intelligent than those integrated to Vim. Together they make more powerful command set for formatting text.

Manual is included, just type

    :help textformat.txt

Default keymappings:

    \al     Left-align and reformat
    \ar     Right-align
    \aj     Left-right justify and reformat
    \ac     Center lines

The prefix key is actually <Leader> key. It's backlash by default but it is configurable.
