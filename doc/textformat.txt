*textformat.txt*	Vim Text Formatter  (version 1.1)	    2008-08-04


Description	This plugin provides commands and key mappings to quickly
		align and format text. Text can be easily reformatted and
		aligned to either left or right margin or justified to both
		margins or centered. Text formatting commands in this plugin
		are a bit different from those integrated to Vim. Together
		they make more powerful command set for formatting text.

==============================================================================
1. Quick start						    *textformat-start*

The impatient ones are always with us so here is the list of (probably) the
most commonly used key mappings for formatting text:

	<Leader>al	Reformat current paragraph and align lines to the
			left.
	<Leader>ar	Align lines of current paragraph to the right.
	<Leader>aj	Reformat current paragraph and justify it to both
			margins. The last line in the paragraph is aligned to
			the left.
	<Leader>ac	Center lines of current paragraph.

By default, <Leader> is the backslash key (\) so by default the mappings are
actually \al, \ar, \aj and \ac. If you have changed the g:mapleader variable
in your .vimrc file <Leader> may be something else.

==============================================================================
2. Commands						 *textformat-commands*

Let's start with the basic components of this plugin. These are the ex
commands. You probably don't need these very often but they can be handy if
you want to have text formatting and aligning as a part of a macro or function
or something. The "daily tools" are explained later.

:[range]AlignLeft [indent]					  *:AlignLeft*
			Align to left all the lines in [range] (default is
			current line) and truncate all extra whitespace
			characters. That is, if there are more than one space
			between words they are reduced to just one. If
			'joinspaces' is set then two spaces are inserted after
			every sentence ending with character ".", "?" or "!".

			If optional numeric argument [indent] is given then
			that is used as the left margin. If [indent] is not
			given the indent of the first line in the [range] is
			used to define indent for the rest of the lines. There
			is one exception: if 'formatoptions' contains "2" then
			the second line in the [range] defines the indent for
			the rest of the lines.

			Note: This is very similar to |:left| command except
			that this also truncates whitespaces and that without
			[indent] the first line's indent is used.

			Note: There is a possible unexpected behaviour: If
			command is run without [range] (i.e., it's just the
			current line) and [indent] is not given then this
			command just "aligns" to the current indent position
			and truncates whitespaces. You might see nothing
			happening if there weren't any extra whitespaces. Use
			[indent] (or |:left| command) to align to desired
			column.

:[range]AlignRight [width]					 *:AlignRight*
			Align to right all the lines in [range] (default is
			current line) and truncate all extra whitespace
			characters (honor 'joinspaces', as in :AlignLeft).
			[width] is used as the right margin. If [width] is not
			given 'textwidth' option is used instead. If
			'textwidth' is zero then the value of 80 is used.

			Note: This is very similar to |:right| command except
			that this also truncates whitespaces.

:[range]AlignJustify [width]				       *:AlignJustify*
			Left-right justify lines in [range] (default is
			current line). This means adjusting spaces between
			words so that the lines fit. If 'joinspaces' is set
			then at least two spaces are printed after every
			sentence ending with ".", "?" or "!". The first line
			in [range] defines the indent for the rest of the
			lines, except if 'formatoptions' contains "2" then
			it's the second line.

			Numeric argument [width] is used as the right margin.
			If [width] is not given 'textwidth' is used instead.
			If 'textwidth' is zero then the value of 80 is used.

			Also see the Discussion below.

:[range]AlignCenter [width]					*:AlignCenter*
			Center lines in [range] (default is current line)
			horizontally between the first column and [width]. All
			extra whitespace characters are truncated but honor
			'joinspaces', just like in :AlignLeft. If [width] is
			not given 'textwidth' option is used instead. If
			'textwidth' is zero the value of 80 is used.

			Note: This is very similar to |:center| except that
			this also truncates whitespaces.

Discussion ~

All previous commands operate on single lines only. They do not wrap lines nor
do other kind of formatting. If [width] (or 'textwidth') is too narrow for the
line then some characters will go beyond the right margin. This is similar to
Vim's own |:left|, |:right| and |:center| commands. You might first want to
adjust line lengths with other editing commands and then run one of the
previous text-formatting commands.

Usually when paragraphs are justified the last line of paragraph is aligned to
left. However, :AlignJustify command (see above) does not do this. The purpose
of this command is to do exactly what was asked for: left-right justify
a range of lines. The general-purpose justification tools is <Leader>aj which
reformats the paragraph (like |gw|), justifies lines and aligns the last line
to left.

Why do these commands truncate whitespaces? Well, this is a text-formatting
tool and in plain text paragraphs any extra spaces are considered
a "typographical flaw." These formatting commands can be used to fix
whitespace errors in plain text. Another reason is that left-right justify
commands need to add extra spaces to make lines fill the text area. If you
later want to reformat previously justified paragraph and align it to left,
for example, it's convenient that the tool automatically handles this and
removes extra spaces. If you want to align text without truncating whitespaces
use Vim's own align commands: |:left|, |:right| and |:center|.

==============================================================================
3. Default key mappings				   *textformat-keymap-default*

By default this plugin provides a couple of key mappings for convenient text
formatting. If the mappings have already been defined by user (or are taken by
other plugins) then some of the following mappings may not be automatically
available. See the next section of this manual for information on how to
change the default mappings.

There are key mappings available for normal mode and visual mode. As usual,
<Leader> is the backslash key by default but it can be changed with
g:mapleader variable. Consult the Vim manual for more information on <Leader>.

Normal mode (current paragraph) ~

<Leader>al		Left-align current paragraph, truncate all whitespace
			characters (but honor 'joinspaces', as in :AlignLeft)
			and reformat the paragraph so that it fits to
			'textwidth'. The first line in the paragraph defines
			the indent for the rest of the lines, except if
			'formatoptions' contains "2" then it's the second
			line.

<Leader>ar		Right-align current paragraph (use 'textwidth') and
			truncate all whitespace characters (but honor
			'joinspaces', as in :AlignLeft). This does not
			reformat lines because with right-aligned text user
			usually wants to decide exactly what goes to what
			line.

<Leader>aj		Left-right justify. Truncate all whitespace characters
			(but honor 'joinspaces', as in :AlignLeft), reformat
			the paragraph so that it fits to 'textwidth' and
			finally left-right justify lines. Extra spaces may be
			added between words so that lines fill the text area.
			Paragraph's last line is aligned to left. The first
			line in the paragraph defines the indent for the rest
			of the lines, except if 'formatoptions' contains "2"
			then it's the second line.

<Leader>ac		Center lines of current paragraph horizontally between
			the first column and 'textwidth'. All whitespace
			characters are truncated, except if 'joinspaces' is
			set then an extra space is added after full sentences
			(see :AlignLeft). This does not reformat the
			paragraph. With centered text user usually wants to
			decide exactly what goes to what line. Reformatting
			would destroy it.

Visual mode (range of lines) ~

{Visual}<Leader>al	Left-align {Visual} lines.
{Visual}<Leader>ar	Right-align {Visual} lines.
{Visual}<Leader>aj	Left-right justify {Visual} lines.
{Visual}<Leader>ac	Center {Visual} lines.

Visual mode mappings do not wrap lines nor otherwise reformat text. They work
line-by-line, just like their command line equivalents: :AlignLeft,
:AlignRight, :AlignJustify and :AlignCenter. (This may change in the future,
though.)

==============================================================================
4. User key mappings				      *textformat-keymap-user*

The key mappings can be configured freely by user. This plugin uses the
default ones only if they are free and not mapped to some other things. We try
to be non-intrusive because this is a general-purpose tool which is likely
loaded automatically when Vim starts.

Here's an example of lines you could put in your .vimrc file: >

	nmap <F5> <Plug>Quick_Align_Paragraph_Left
	nmap <F6> <Plug>Quick_Align_Paragraph_Right
	nmap <F7> <Plug>Quick_Align_Paragraph_Justify
	nmap <F8> <Plug>Quick_Align_Paragraph_Center

	vmap <F5> <Plug>Align_Range_Left
	vmap <F6> <Plug>Align_Range_Right
	vmap <F7> <Plug>Align_Range_Justify
	vmap <F8> <Plug>Align_Range_Center

That is, |:nmap| command defines mappings for normal mode and |:vmap| for
visual mode. Function keys from <F5> to <F8> are used in this example. The
rest of the line is a code word for this plugin; they tell Vim what to do.
I think the code words are pretty much self-descriptive.

Don't use |:nnoremap| and |:vnoremap| commands here; they don't work because
the right-hand side (<Plug>...) must be remappable. See Vim's manual for more
information about mapping commands.

Happy formatting!

==============================================================================
5. Version history					  *textformat-history*

	v1.1							    2008-08-04

	      - Keep cursor position more accurately when formatting
		a paragraph with \al and \aj.
	      - When 'joinspaces' is set insert two spaces after .?!
		punctuation with left-right justify. This is now similar to
		other commands.

	v1.0							    2008-08-03

	      - All the commands now follow user's 'expandtab' setting and
		print leading whitespaces accordingly. Now this works just
		like :left, :right and :center commands.
	      - The left-aligned last line in justified paragraph did not
		honor 'joinspaces'. Fixed.

	v0.9							    2008-08-01

	      - Initial upload to http://www.vim.org .

Possible future improvements ~

      - Visual mode \al and \aj could reformat lines with |gw|. It's probably
	what user expects anyway.

      - Visual mode \aj could detect if there are paragraph endings within the
	visual area and left-align such paragraphs' last line as well as the
	visual area's last line. This way it would be similar to what Emacs's
	C-u M-q does with a region which contains several paragraphs. Again,
	this is probably the most expected behaviour. The ex command, in turn,
	would work just line-by-line and not try to do smart things. Simple
	commands are good building blocks for users' own scripts and mappings.

      - Make left align (maybe justify too) act differently when
	'formatoptions' has "w". Then trailing whitespace(s) would mean that
	the paragraph continues to the next line. Also, trailing space should
	not be stripped when fo+=w (i.e., make it similar to |gw|).
